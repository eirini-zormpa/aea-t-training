# About
This repository conrains the materials used to teach a two-day introduction to R, presented as part of the [AEA Conference 2023](https://envarch.net/news#682feaad-5943-46b3-8d17-9b83179054eb).
The workshop took place a few week after the conference, on 2 and 3 July.

This is a hands-on live-conding workshop; you can find the scripts that were created during the two sessions in the `demos` folder.
The links to the slides for the two days can be found below:

- [Slides for Day 1](https://eirini-zormpa.github.io/aea-t-training/slides/day1.html#/title-slide).
- [Slides for Day 2](https://eirini-zormpa.github.io/aea-t-training/slides/day2.html#/title-slide).

These materials were based on the [Data Carpentry curriculum for Archaelogists](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/R-archaeology-lesson/index.html).
