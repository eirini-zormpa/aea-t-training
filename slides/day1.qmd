# Part 1: Introduction to R

## Why R?

`R` is a programming language and the software used to interpret it.
It is **free** and **open source**. :x: :moneybag: = :tada:

It is great for:

- **reproducibility**: `R` is not point-and-click, so when repeating an analysis, you don't have to remember what you pressed when. It's all written down for you in a script!
- **working with data**: `R` was created by statisticians for statistics. It has useful features for data analysis and allows you to make beautiful graphics.
- **working in any discipline**: `R` is open source, meaning anyone can contribute code to extend its functionality (currently in 10,000+ packages).

## Why R Studio?

**RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment with a **free and open-source version**, which makes working with `R` much easier. It: 

- makes it easier to develop code by allowing us to navigate computer files and inspect data and variables. We will use R entirely through RStudio.
- supports reproducibility through features like `projects`.
- provides a Graphical User Interface to work with `git`.

::: aside
*RStudio* used to also be the name of the company that develops RStudio but they are currently rebranding as *Posit*.
:::

## Learning objectives - part 1

- :white_check_mark: Navigate the RStudio Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- :white_check_mark: Install `packages` to access additional functionality.
- :white_check_mark: Perform simple arithmetic calculations in R.
- :white_check_mark: Understand programming terms, like `objects`, `functions`, `arguments` and `vectors`.
- :white_check_mark: Learn basic ways to work with missing data.

## R Projects: File paths :recycle:

Below you see two ways of reading data into R.
They both work and they both access the same file.
Which one looks more reproducible?:


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# option 1: absolute path
covid_data <- read_csv("/Users/ezormpa/Documents/aea-r-training/data/ceramics_data.csv")

# option 2: relative path
covid_data <- read_csv("data/ceramics_data.csv")
```

. . .

Option 2 is more reproducible, as it allows you to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without having to directly modify file paths in the individual scripts.

## R Projects: Folder structure :recycle:

It is good practice to keep all files related to a project in a single folder, called the `working directory`.
This includes data, scripts, outputs, and documentation.  

This makes sharing and documenting your projects much easier.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
  A[working-directory] --> B["data_raw/"]
  A[working-directory] --> C["data_clean/"]
  A[working-directory] --> D["figures/"]
  A[working-directory] --> E([LICENCE.md])
  A[working-directory] --> F([paper.qmd])
  A[working-directory] --> G([README.md])
  A[working-directory] --> H["scripts/"]

```

## Create an R Project

1. Under the **`File`** menu, click on **`New project`**
2. In the wizard that pops up click on **`New directory`** > **`New project`**
3. You will now create the working directory for the rest of the workshop and save it in a convenient location.
4. Give a good name to your new directory (folder), e.g. **`r-workshop`**. Make sure your name doesn't have spaces or special characters!
5. Click on **`Browse`** and navigate to a suitable location for this repository and click on **`Open`** when you are in a location you are happy with.
3. Click on **`Create project`**.

## Exercise 1.1

:alarm_clock: **3 mins**

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 3)
```


Find out the current content of the object `weight_lb`.

## Exercise 1.1 solution

Because we have not rerun the code `weight_lb <- 2.2*weight_kg` after assigning the new value of `weight_kg` the value of `weight_lb` is still `143`.

## Exercise 1.2

:alarm_clock: **5 mins**

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r}
#| echo: true

mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?

```


## Functions and their arguments

**Functions** are like "canned" scripts that do a specific task. 

They usually take some kind of input (called an **argument**) and often give back some kind of output. 

Running or executing a function is often termed **calling** a function. 

The arguments of functions can be anything: e.g. numbers, filenames, but also other objects.

## Vectors and data structures

A **vector** is the simplest R data structure. 

It is composed by a series of values **of the same type**, e.g.*character* and *numeric* (or *double*). 

Other vector types are: *logical* for `TRUE` and `FALSE`, *integer* for integer numbers and two others we won't discuss (*complex* and *raw*).


The other data structure, other than vectors, we'll talk about in these workshops is the **tibble**, which is a dataframe. 

## Exercise 1.3

:alarm_clock: **10 mins**

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 10)
```

What will happen in each of these examples?

```{r}
#| echo: true

num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

**Hint**: use `typeof()` to check the data type of your objects

## Exercise 1.3 solution

Vectors can be of only **one data type**. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common denominator" that doesn’t lose any information.

## Exercise 1.4

:alarm_clock: **10 mins**

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 10)
```


```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
```

1. Using the above vector, create a new vector with the NAs removed.
2. Use the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.
3. How many people in the set are taller than 67 inches?

## Interim summary 1

So far you have learned how to:

- interact with the RStudio GUI, 
- set up projects, 
- create files from RStudio, 
- assign values to objects, 
- use functions, 
- create and subset vectors, 
- work with missing data 

# Part 2: Starting with data

## Learning objectives

- :white_check_mark: Read data into R.
- :white_check_mark: Understand and manipulate `data frames`.
- :white_check_mark: Understand and manipulate `factors`.
- :white_check_mark: Alternate between date formats.

## Data frames

**Data frames** are the standard data structure for tabular data in `R`. 

They look very similar to spreadsheets (like in Excel) but each column is, in fact, a vector.
Each vector needs to be of the same length, for a perfectly rectangular shape :black_square_button:

Note that because the columns are all vectors, they must all be of the *same type*.

### A note on terminology

Technically, what we will be working with in these workshops aren't `data.frames`, they are `tibbles`.
`tibbles` are basically data frames for the `tidyverse` - they have some subtle differences but nothing you need to be aware of at this point.

## Tabular data: What is tidy data?

## Tabular data: File formats

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Comma-delimited (.csv)

- :thumbsup: commonly used
- :thumbsdown: annoying when data itself contains commas

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Tab-delimited (.tsv)

- :thumbsup: no confusion when data contains commas or semicolons
- :thumbsdown: not very commonly used (at least not yet)

## The data

:warning: **NOT REAL DATA** :warning:

Modified data for the purposes of training, created by Alison Clarke and Michelle de Gruchy.

:link: [Source](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6501593)

## The data: variables

| variable | description |
|----------|-------------|
| period | the period from which the artefact dates |
| decoration_type | the type of decoration of the artefact |
| ceramic_type | the type of ceramic of the artefact |
| manufacture_technique | the technique used to manufacture the artefact |


## Importing data: Folders

1. Double click on the R Project you created for the workshop to open RStudio.
2. Check that the files you see in your `Files` tab are the right ones (you should only see the `scripts` folder and the `.Rproj` file)
3. Go to the console and type the following commands

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# create separate folders for the raw and clean data
dir.create("data_raw")
dir.create("data_clean")

# only if you don't have one already, create a folder for the scripts
dir.create("scripts")
```

## Importing data: Download

Then we need to 1) download the data from Zenodo and 2) save it in the `data_raw` folder we just created it.

We can do both in one go in R by typing the following command in the console:

```{r download-data, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# download the data
download.file(url = "https://zenodo.org/record/6478181/files/ceramics_data.csv?download=1",
              destfile = here("data_raw/ceramics_data.csv"))
```

After you have run this command, open the `data_raw` folder and check that there is a file called `ceramics_data.csv`.

## Exercise 2.1

:alarm_clock: **5 mins**

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

- What is the class of the object `surveys`?
- How many rows and how many columns are in this object?

## Exercise 2.1 solution

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

str(surveys)
```

`* class: data frame`

`* how many rows: 34786,  how many columns: 13`

## Exercise 2.2

- Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.
- Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
  - Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
  - Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure it’s meeting expectations.
  - Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.
  - Create a new data frame (surveys_last) from that last row.
- Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.
- Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the `surveys` dataset.

## Exercise 2.2 solution

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

## 1.
surveys_200 <- surveys[200, ]
## 2.
# Saving `n_rows` to improve readability and reduce duplication
n_rows <- nrow(surveys)
surveys_last <- surveys[n_rows, ]
## 3.
surveys_middle <- surveys[n_rows / 2, ]
## 4.
surveys_head <- surveys[-(7:n_rows), ]
```

## Factors

R has a special data class, called **factor**, to deal with *categorical data*.
Factors are very useful and contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data.

Factors are stored as **integers** associated with labels. 

They can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). 

Factors create a structured relation between the different levels (values) of a categorical variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in a survey. 

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as **levels**.

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. **So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.**

## Exercise 2.3

:alarm_clock: **5 mins**

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

1. Change the columns `manufacture_technique` and `decoration_type` in the `surveys` data frame into a factor.
2. Using the functions you learned before, can you find out…
  - How many artefacts were manufactured using a slab technique?
  - How many different decoration types are in the `decoration_type` column?


## Exercise 2.3 solution

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

surveys$manufacture_technique <- factor(surveys$manufacture_technique)
surveys$decoration_type <- factor(surveys$decoration_type)
summary(surveys)
nlevels(surveys$decoration_type)

```


## Dates

To avoid ambiguity, use the [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) standard: **YYYYMMDD** (or YYYY-MM-DD).

## Programming note

When we say R is a language, we mean just that: We need to learn **a new way of communicating** that lets us talk to the R software. 

Software isn't as smart as humans and have no tolerance for errors: if we don't tell it what we do just the way it wants, it won't work. 

Learning how to speak the software's language takes time and practice. Today you learned **so much**: 

# Thank you for your attention :sparkles:

**See you tomorrow for data wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr` :wave:**
